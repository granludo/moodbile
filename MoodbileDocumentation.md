This is the documentation site of the Moodbile (Mobile Learning for Moodle) project.

The [Moodbile](http://moodbile.org) project aims to enable Mobile Learning Apps to work together with the Learning Management System (LMS). Moodbile is an open source project. The open source LMS [Moodle](http://moodle.org) is used as host LMS platform in the first stage of the project. Rather than just creating mobile Apps that replicates the LMS functionalites on a mobile device, Moodbile provides the developers of Mobile Learning Apps with the necessary tools to talk with the LMS.

## Moodbile components ##

### Moodbile Webservices Specification ###

**'''[[MoodbileSpec](MoodbileSpec.md)]''' is a specification of (web)services for supporting the integration of external apps with the LMS. The '''Moodbile Spec''' (web)services are not bound to a specific Webservices protocol. The Services need to be implemented in the LMS side. For the version 0.2 of the Moodbile Spec we provide the '''[[forMoodlev0.2](MoodbileServer.md)]''' as a reference implementation for [Moodle](http://moodle.org)**

### Moodbile: server for Moodle ###

**'''[[Server for Moodle](Moodbile.md)]''' -  Moodle 2.0.X plug-in that implements the Moodbile Spec. Current version '''[[Server for Moodle v0.2](Moodbile.md)]''' has been tested for [Moodle](http://moodle.org) 2.0.5 and can work on Moodle 2.0.x. For support for other Moodle versions check the [[roadmap](Moodbile.md)]**

### Moodbile Apps. ###

**'''[[HTML 5 Client](Moodbile.md)]''' Moodbile Client that runs on most mobile browsers. [[HTML 5 Client](Moodbile.md)] runs on the same web server as the LMS and provides a Mobile Web friendly   limited front, using the Moodbile Spec (web)services.  [[HTML 5 Client](Moodbile.md)] is intended also to be a '''reference implementation''' of howto access the [[Spec](Moodbile.md)] (web)services  from '''HTML5 / Ajax'''.** '''[[Android Client](Moodbile.md)]''' Android App that provides a limited front end to the LMS written on native Android code. [[Android Client](Moodbile.md)] is intended also to be a '''reference implementation''' of howto access the [[Spec](Moodbile.md)] (web)services  from Android™ clients. Check the [[Android Client](Moodbile.md)] documentation page for a full list of features and more.
**'''[[iOS Client](Moodbile.md)]''' Comming soon, please check the [[roadmap](Moodbile.md)] for details on schedule.**

Moodbile is a project iniciated by the SUSHITOS Research Group of the UPC Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, whose members have been involved with the Moodle.org community since 2004, participating in the development of the Moodle 2.0 Wiki, the Webservices subsystem and the IMSLTI consumer. This project is aimed as a new contribution to the community and we hope some parts of the Moodbile will find its way into the Moodle core distribution.
