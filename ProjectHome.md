The Moodbile project aims to enable Software as a Service (SaaS) and Mobile Learning Apps to work together with the Learning Management System (LMS). Moodbile is an open source project. The open source LMS Moodle is used as host LMS platform in the first stage of the project. Rather than just creating  Apps that replicates the LMS functionalites on a mobile device, Moodbile provides the developers of SaaS and Mobile Learning Apps with the necessary tools to talk with the LMS.
