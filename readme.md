# About Moodbile

Since Moodle 2.0 (and the backport to 1,9) Moodle has a set of webservices connectors. Moodbile is a PHP based web Application that plugs into these services, and allows the Student to access part of the Moodle's Learning Tools from a Mobile Browser (Android, iPhone, etc) and devices like the OLPC XO.

Moodbile is also intended to be a reference implementation of a client for the Moodle Webservices, since the Moodbile team is also responsible for developing and maintaining Webservices at Moodle.org

Moodbile is a project iniciated and leaded by María José Casany, Ludo(Marc Alier) and Jordi Piguillem at the GESSI research group at UPC.

With main contributions from Imanol Urra at UPC, and Miguel Angel Conde at Universidad de Salamanca.
